/**
 * This is the base-class for all service-loadable factory classes, that build the Lucene Analyzer instances that are available to the fulltext schema index.
 * The analyzer factory is referenced in the index configuration via its {@code analyzerName} and {@code alternativeNames} that are specific to the constructor
 * of this base class. Sub-classes must have a public no-arg constructor such that they can be service-loaded.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example that implements an analyzer provider for the {@code SwedishAnalyzer} that comes built into Lucene:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * public class Swedish extends AnalyzerProvider
 * {
 *     public Swedish()
 *     {
 *         super( "swedish" );
 *     }
 *
 *     public Analyzer createAnalyzer()
 *     {
 *         return new SwedishAnalyzer();
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * The {@code jar} that includes this implementation must also contain a {@code META-INF/services/org.neo4j.graphdb.index.fulltext.AnalyzerProvider} file,
 * that contains the fully-qualified class names of all of the {@code AnalyzerProvider} implementations it contains.
